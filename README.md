This is a package developed by us for internal use. It is supposed to help us during development and save plenty of time by automating many steps while creating typical CRUD entities with [Laravel Backpack](https://laravel-backpack.readme.io/docs). You can write your own Services (they have to implement `Webfactor\Laravel\Generators\Contracts\ServiceInterface`) and register them in the `generators.php` config file, or use this package as an inspiration for your own implementation.

## Install

### Via Composer

This package is indended to be used only for development, not for production. Because of that we recommend to use `require-dev`:

``` bash
composer require --dev webfactor/laravel-generators
```

## Usage

``` bash
php artisan make:entity {entity_name} {--schema=} {--ide=}
```

`--schema` currently uses syntax from [Laravel 5 Extended Generators](https://github.com/laracasts/Laravel-5-Generators-Extended) (this will be slightly changed in upcoming v3.0 to provide an extended functionality)

Use *singular* for entity. This will automatically create (while respecting our internal naming conventions):

* Migration
* Factory
* Seeder
* Backpack CRUD (modified Backpack Generator):
  * Model (incl. `$fillable`)
  * Request (incl. `rules()`)
  * Controller (incl. CrudColumns and CrudFields, basic for now)
* Language File
* Route to Backpack CRUD in admin.php

### Open files in IDE

With `{--ide=}` option you can define your preferred IDE to open all automatically generated files. This package comes with an implementation for PhpStorm (`Webfactor\Laravel\Generators\RecipesPhpStormOpener`) which is defined in `generators.php`. The keys in the `ides`-Array are possible values for the command option. You can add other IDE-Opener classes, they have to implement `Webfactor\Laravel\Generators\Contracts\OpenInIdeInterface`.`

In your service class you have to define the path to the file generated by this service. Then add `$this->addLatestFileToIdeStack();` and all files of the stack will be opened by `Webfactor\Laravel\Generators\Services\OpenIdeService` (should be placed at the end of the `services`-array in `generators.php)

Example:

```php
<?php

class ExampleService extends ServiceAbstract implements ServiceInterface
{
    protected $relativeToBasePath = 'path/to/file';

    public function call()
    {
        // do some magic

        // searches for latest file (using modified date) in given directory and adds it to the stack
        $this->addLatestFileToIdeStack();
    }
}
```

## Adaption

Feel free to write your own Services that fit your purposes!
